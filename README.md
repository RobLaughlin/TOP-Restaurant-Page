# TOP Restaurant Page
The [Restaurant Page Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Live Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://roblaughlin.github.io/TOP-Restaurant-Page/). This demo is more of a showcase of how component functionality can be embedded in navbar buttons and decoupled from the main index.js logic, as well as how to use webpack to optimize and bundle the html, css, and js.
